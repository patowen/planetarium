Using ephemeris data to simulate the solar system

Special thanks to the following websites for texture files:
http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/textures.html (Earth texture)
https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=3895 (Star map)
https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures (Moon texture)

To get texture files and data files for ephemeris data, please use the latest release of this project. These kinds of files do not work well with version control.
