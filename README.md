Using ephemeris data to simulate the solar system

Special thanks to the following websites for texture files:
- http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/textures.html (Earth texture)
- https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=3895 (Star map)
- https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures (Moon texture)

Also a special thanks to the following "websites" for the information needed to calculate planet and moon positions:
- ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/planets/vsop2013/solution/
- ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/moon/elp82b/

To get texture files and data files for ephemeris data, please use the latest release of this project. These kinds of files do not work well with version control.
